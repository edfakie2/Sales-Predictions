# Sales Predictions
## Grocery Stores 

**Edward Fakier**: 

### Business problem:

Grocery Store and Super Market Owens are tying to understand which products and which stores and locations drive the highest profits.


### Data:
My finding in the data where that the oweners should spend less time worrying about visiablity and more time worrying about Smaller stores. It seems to me that after a curtain price point that it become far less likely to profitable. I would recommened collectiong more data on some different metrics to form a more clear understanding of whats at play for my findings. 


## Methods
- I used various data cleaning and module testing to arrive at these results. Some of my favorite example are pictured through the links below. 
- I found that using Various Tree style models to be the most effecint for future price predictions

> Sales seem to me mostly in smaller venues and by volume


## Limitations & Next Steps

I believe that for more accurate data more variable must be collected. For example item weight. spend less time collecting data like that and more colleting for example: Self time, Waste, Volume of Customers. These metrics would be much more helpful when trying to determine success of not only products but the stores themselves selling those products.
